            Pokemon Showdown! is a website where you can battle online against other players, relax and talk to moderators and players, or join a tournament! There are several game modes, like Random Battle, where a set of pokemon is generated for you, tiers, which allow you to make their own deck as long as they are in that tier or below, and National Deck which allows you to use all the pokemon to build for a deck! It has many items, abilites, attacks and pokemon. It has pokemon from Generation 1-9 and includes mega evolution, dynamax, and even the new terralizationing! Not to mention, they have something called CAP, which is a bunch of fakemon (custom pokemon) and you can use them to fight! So what are you waiting for? Jump in!
